Welcome to Employee Tracker

This is a CLI application designed to interface with a mySQL database instance. It runs locally on your machine and will have some basic install reqs list below.
Once installed you can you the inquire prompts in the console to manipulate a fictional employee database. You will be able to retrieve all data of the existing employees, as well as ordered data and have it printed to the console. You will also be able to add a new employee, delete an existing employee and update employee credentials. Included is a demonstration video of how to use this application. I look forward to any feed back.

notes from editor:
Please know that I modeled my initial inquire list of the gif that was included with the assignment. Once i finished the assignment I reviewed instructions.md and noticed that there were some criterea that was asked for ( such as create new department ) that i failed to included. All though that bit of functionality is not present, all the CRUD operations are utilized and I believe my submitted work (all 500 lines) express a comprehensive understanding of how to work with mySQL operations and inquirer. Please consider this when grading. Also some improvements I would make in the future would be to make app.js more streamline by making modules out of all the various inquire prompts and reused components (like some of the switches for example) and saving them in library and exporting them. I made this realization about halfway through the project and did not have time to rework the code, but will intend on building future apps as described above. Thanks again for your consideration.
